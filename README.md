# Term-Deposits-Classification

To maximise the Net Interest Margin by attracting more deposits that will act as a source of funds to be laoned out, this project aims to classify whether a Customer uptakes a term deposit account after the Bnak's RMs gives them a call.

Other features were also provided, including Macroeconomic features.

The model performance can be improved by further feature engineering the features.

Next steps include deploying the model and precitions on a PowerBi dashboard to allow for ease of communication to non-techinal users
